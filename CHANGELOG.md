## Changes ðŸŒ½
- Updated dependencies.
- Added support for `appleskin` (although projection of health increases will have to come in another update).
- Added support for `thermoo` (frostiful & scorchiful) temperature values.
  - They are recorded in the health bar (as progress bars due to lack of texturing).
- The mod requires **Fabric Language Kotlin** now.
- Added more config options (this extends to having the original EXP/jump power hud back).
